# weather-app
React app to get information about the weather of any city of the world.

## how to test it?
Get/download this repository, then make sure to create a file called credentials.js (into src folder) and in it save the following information:

```js
module.exports = {
    API_KEY_OW: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    API_KEY_GM: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```
IMPORTANT: Those APIs must be obtained from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/) respectively. 
 

Then, through the terminal, go to the weather-app folder that is inside the main folder, execute the command <b>npm install</b> and then <b>npm start</b> and that's it.
